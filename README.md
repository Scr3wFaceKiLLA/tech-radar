# Motivation

What is Core Context?
The Elantis Core Context Tech Radar is a list of technologies, that have a ring assignment. We use four rings with the following semantics:

MANAGE — Technologies we have high confidence in to serve our purpose, also in large scale. Technologies with a usage culture in our Elantis production environment, low risk and recommended to be widely used.
STRATEGIC — Technologies that we have seen work with success in project work to solve a real problem; first serious usage experience that confirm benefits and can uncover limitations. Strategic technologies are slightly more risky; some engineers in our organization walked this path and will share knowledge and experiences.
FUTURE GROWTH — Technologies that are promising and have clear potential value-add for us; technologies worth to invest some research and prototyping efforts in to see if it has impact. Future Growth technologies have higher risks; they are often brand new and highly unproven in our organisation. You will find some engineers that have knowledge in the technology and promote it, you may even find teams that have started a prototyping effort.
DISTRACTION — Technologies not recommended to be used for new projects. Technologies that we think are not (yet) worth to (further) invest in. These technologies should not be used for new projects, but usually can be continued for existing projects.

It is based on the [pioneering work
by ThoughtWorks](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar).

This repository contains the code to generate the visualization:
[`radar.js`](/docs/radar.js) (based on [d3.js v4](https://d3js.org)).
Feel free to use and adapt it for your own purposes.

## Usage

1. include `d3.js` and `radar.js`:

```html
<script src="https://d3js.org/d3.v4.min.js"></script>
<script src="http://zalando.github.io/tech-radar/release/radar-0.5.js"></script>
```

2. insert an empty `svg` tag:

```html
<svg id="radar"></svg>
```

3. configure the radar visualization:

```js
radar_visualization({
  svg_id: "radar",
  width: 1450,
  height: 1000,
  colors: {
    background: "#fff",
    grid: "#bbb",
    inactive: "#ddd"
  },
  title: "My Radar",
  quadrants: [
    { name: "Bottom Right" },
    { name: "Bottom Left" },
    { name: "Top Left" },
    { name: "Top Right" }
  ],
  rings: [
    { name: "INNER",  color: "#93c47d" },
    { name: "SECOND", color: "#b7e1cd" },
    { name: "THIRD",  color: "#fce8b2" },
    { name: "OUTER",  color: "#f4c7c3" }
  ],
  print_layout: true,
  entries: [
   {
      label: "Some Entry",
      quadrant: 3,          // 0,1,2,3 (counting clockwise, starting from bottom right)
      ring: 2,              // 0,1,2,3 (starting from inside)
      moved: -1             // -1 = moved out (triangle pointing down)
                            //  0 = not moved (circle)
                            //  1 = moved in  (triangle pointing up)
   },
    // ...
  ]
});
```

Entries are positioned automatically so that they don't overlap.

As a working example, you can check out `docs/index.html` &mdash; the source of our [public Tech
Radar](http://zalando.github.io/tech-radar/).

## Local Development

1. install dependencies with yarn (or npm):

```
yarn 
```

2. start local dev server:

```
yarn start
```

3. your default browser should automatically open and show the url
 
```
http://localhost:3000/
```
